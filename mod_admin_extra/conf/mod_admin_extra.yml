# The configurable options are:
# - module_resource:
#   Indicate the resource that the XMPP stanzas must use in the FROM or TO JIDs.
#   This is only useful in the vcard set and get commands.
#   The default value is "mod_admin_extra".
# 
# In this example configuration, the users vcards can only be modified
# by executing mod_admin_extra commands.
