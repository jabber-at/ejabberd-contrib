	Feature requests for mod_webpresence


	Internationalization support
	----------------------------

 - The "text" output returns an empty string if the user doesn't have a status text.
 Proposal: in such case, return the string "Online", or "Busy" or whatever

 - The special cases in "presence/" and "presence/themes" should return 
 a header lang=xx with the proper language instead of lang=en

 - The Icon Themes page should show the translated status.

 - Allow translation of separator commas and ending dots in lists of elements, 
 since some languages may use other separation symbols.

 - Support the HTML attribute dir=(ltr|rtl) for languages that are RTL
 For example:
    {xmlelement, "html", [{"xmlns", "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"}, ...
        {"dir", ltr_or_rtl()}
 And ltr_or_rtl() ->  ?T("ltr").
 This way RTL languages can change that string to rtl
