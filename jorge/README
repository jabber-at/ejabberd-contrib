Client Requirements:
- Jorge is tested and compatibile with: Firefox 2.x, Firefox 3.x, Opera 9.x, Apple Safri 3.x,4.x and Google Chrome (IE7 and IE8+ may work but it is not recomended due to IE standards violations, IE6 is not supported at all)
- Web-browser _must_ have enabled javascript as Jorge strongly relay on jQuery and other js related scripts
- Cookies must be enabled

Installing:
- setup XML-RPC facility (mod_xmlrpc, available at http://svn.process-one.net/ejabberd-modules/mod_xmlrpc/trunk/ - Use rev772!)
- copy Jorge files into your http server (sugested vhost over SSL connection).
- set up database for Jorge (install/jorge.sql), see README inside install dir
- copy config.php.inc to config.php and edit file - READ CAREFULLY
- that's it!

Archive usage:
We can say that 1 milion messeges collected by the server consume approx. 65 Megabytes. Depending on number of users that use your server and
how many will activate logging, you must compute db partitions.
