	Author: Badlop
	Module for ejabberd 0.7.5 or newer


	DESCRIPTION
	-----------

This module sniffs all the XMPP traffic send and received by ejabberd,
both internally and externally transmitted. It logs the XMPP packets
to a XML formatted file. It's posible to filter transmitted packets 
by orientation, stanza and direction. It's possible to configure the 
file rotation rules and intervals.

This module reuses code from mod_log_forensic, mod_stats2file, mod_muc_log

     {timezone, universal}, 
     {show_ip, false},  % To enable this option you need ejabberd 2.0.0 or newer
     {rotate_days, 1}, 
     {rotate_megs, 100}, 
     {rotate_kpackets, no},
     {check_rotate_kpackets, 1}
  ]},
  ...
