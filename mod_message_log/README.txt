	mod_message_log - Log one line per message transmission

	Author: Holger Weiss <holger@zedat.fu-berlin.de>
	Requirements: ejabberd 13.x or newer


	DESCRIPTION
	-----------

This module writes a line for each sent or received message to a log file.
Each line mentions the sender's JID and the recipient's JID, and also the
message type (e.g., "normal", "chat", or "groupchat").  Carbon copies are
marked as such.  The log lines look similar to this one:

  2014-05-25 11:55:04 [outgoing, normal] dan@example.com/Foo -> eve@example.net/Bar

After log rotation, you can execute the following command in order to tell
mod_message_log to reopen the log file:

  ejabberdctl reopen_log


	CONFIGURATION
	-------------

In order to use this module, add the following lines to the modules section
of your ejabberd.yml file:

  mod_message_log:
    filename: "/path/to/ejabberd-message.log"
